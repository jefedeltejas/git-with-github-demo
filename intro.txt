                           -----------------------


                               INTRODUCTION:


               Welcome to the premiere issue of the LOD/H TJ!

     The LOD/H TJ is a soft-copy free newsletter whose primary purpose is to
further the knowledge of those who are interested in topics such as:
Telecommunications, Datacommunications, Computer & Physical Security/Insecurity
and the various technical aspects of the phone system.

     The articles contained herein, are totally original unless otherwise
stated. All sources of information for a specific article is listed in the
introduction or conclusion of the atricle. We will not accept any articles that
are unoriginal, plagiarized, or contain invalid or false information. Articles
will be accepted from anyone who meets those criteria. We are not dependant
upon readers for articles, since members of LOD/H and a select group of others
will be the primary contributers, but anyone can submit articles.

     Readers are encouraged to download all files for each issue, not just the
ones they are interested in. The reason for this is twofold: The newsletter
was designed to be a group effort, and the files herein were not intended for
individual distribution, and secondly, keeping the issue intact allows you to
distribute it to other BBS's and phriends who are interested in it.

     There is no set date for releasing issues, as we have no monetary or legal
obligation to the readers, but we predict subsequent issues will be released
between 2 and 3 months from the previous one. Thus, expect 4 to 6 issues a year
assuming we continue to produce them, which we intend to do.

     Newsletter sponsors are boards which will get the newsletter directly from
the staff as soon as it is released, and has added our 'staff account' to the
userlist in order for the readers to respond directly to us about the content
of the newsletter. If your board would like to become a sponsor, leave us mail
on any of the following sponsors boards:

     An LOD/H TJ staff account is on all our sponsor BBS's. This allows readers
to get in contact with us for the following reasons:

* If you have questions about any article, or question the validity of the
  material, you are welcome to contact us through the staff account and leave
  a way for the author to contact you. This insures a better understanding from
  the readers of the topic and also, insures the integrity of the author as far
  as knowledge and originality of the topic is concerned.

* You may leave questions for the staff which will be answered in our 'Ask the
  Staff' section of the newsletter. The questions selected will be of general
  interest to others. Any questions not published will try to be answered via
  E-Mail. We don't know everything, but anything we do know will be shared
  with those who ask.

     Various features of the newsletter include:

Editorials: These will feature short articles on topics which affect the
            telecom world in general.

Network News & Notes: News articles and other things of interest pertaining to
                      the things this newsletter specializes in.

Reader Mail: Questions and comments about previous issues from readers who
             contact us through our staff account on sponsor boards.

Special Features: These will pop up from time to time and can be anything which
                  does not fit in the general format of the newsletter.
